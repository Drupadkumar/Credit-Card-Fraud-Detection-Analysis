# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Analysis
In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for the banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.

 

Suppose you are part of the analytics team working on a fraud detection model and its cost-benefit analysis. You need to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants. You can learn more about transactional data and the creation of historical variables from the link attached here. You may find this helpful in the capstone project while building the fraud detection model. Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks.

 

# Understanding and Defining Fraud

Credit card fraud is any dishonest act or behaviour to obtain information without the proper authorisation of the account holder for financial gain. Among the different ways of committing fraud, skimming is the most common one. Skimming is a method used for duplicating information located on the magnetic stripe of the card.  Apart from this, other ways of making fraudulent transactions are as follows:

Manipulation or alteration of genuine cards
Creation of counterfeit cards
Stolen or lost credit cards
Fraudulent telemarketing
